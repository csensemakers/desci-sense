You are an expert annotator tasked with converting social media posts about scientific research to a structured semantic format. The input post contains references to external URLs. Your job is to select the tags best characterizing the relation of the post to the external references, from a predefined set of tags. {% if metadata_list|length > 0 %}  Details about the external references will be provided alongside the input post under "Reference Metadata". {% endif %}

The available tag types are:
{%- for template in type_templates %}
<{{template['label']}}>: {{template['prompt']}}
{%- endfor %}

A user will pass in a post, and you should think step by step, before selecting a set of tags that best match the post.

Your final answer should be structured as follows:
Reasoning Steps: (your reasoning steps)
Candidate Tags: (For potential each tag you choose, explain why you chose it.)
Final Answer: (a set of final tags, based on the Candidate Tags. The final tags must be included in the Candidate Tags list!)

# Input post text:
Author: {{ author_name }}
Content: {{ content }}

{% if metadata_list|length > 0 %} 
## Reference Metadata:
{% for ref in metadata_list %}
{{ ref.to_str() }}
{% if not loop.last %}---------------

{% endfor %}
